# --output-format stream-json, not the default text: the text renderer prefixes
# every line with "• ", interleaves the model's visible reasoning with the
# answer, and appends a "To resume this session: …" footer. All three would end
# up quoted verbatim in the council's synthesis. The JSONL stream separates them
# cleanly — role "assistant" is the answer, role "meta" is the session hint.
# Restrict the agent to no tools at all. This matters more here than for the
# other CLIs: `kimi -p` runs under the auto permission policy, so every tool
# call — file writes, shell — is approved with no prompt. codex merely
# inherited whatever ~/.codex/config.toml defaulted to; this grants execution
# unconditionally, on a prompt that can carry --file contents or, in debate
# mode, another provider's answer. Same intent as codex's -s read-only and
# grok-cli's --sandbox read-only.
#
# --agent-file rather than --plan: kimi's read-only plan mode is the obvious
# candidate but the CLI rejects it outright here — "error: Cannot combine
# --prompt with --plan" (verified against kimi-code 0.31.1). An agent file is
# the mechanism that does compose with -p, and its tools/disallowedTools are
# enforced before execution rather than only shaping what the model is offered.
